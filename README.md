# Cloud Foundry and Apigee Edge Integration

This repository includes code you can use to integrate Apigee Edge with Cloud Foundry (including Pivotal and open source instances). Using this integration, you can proxy your Cloud Foundry apps with proxies hosted on either [Apigee Edge in the cloud](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/what-apigee-edge) or [Edge Microgateway](http://docs.apigee.com/microgateway/latest/overview-edge-microgateway).

For a sample Cloud Foundry app for testing this integration, see [Sample Code](sample-api).

Generally, this integration requires:

- An Apigee service broker installed on Cloud Foundry. Instances of the service broker route incoming requests to a proxy for management before sending them to the Cloud Foundry app.
- If you're using Edge Microgateway, you'll need an Edge Microgateway plugin that you can install from code in this repository. 

The integrations below are enabled. See the following for suggested processes and best practices.
